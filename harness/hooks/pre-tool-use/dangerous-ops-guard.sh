# dangerous-ops-guard (PreToolUse wrapper, POSIX sh)
#
# Event: PreToolUse. Matcher: Bash.
# Decision: deny (permissionDecision in the JSON) for a modeled destructive shape, or silence.
# Delegates to harness/hooks/lib/dangerous_ops_guard.py, which reads the JSON envelope on stdin and
# prints zero or one JSON line. Exits 0 unconditionally: a missing lib file
# or a missing Python is silence (fail open), and the decision lives in the
# JSON, never in the exit code.

# Locate this file with shell builtins only, so the wrapper works even when
# the parent process supplies a PATH without the POSIX userland tools.
# Either separator may appear: a Windows host hands the wrapper a backslash
# path, a POSIX host a forward-slash path.
